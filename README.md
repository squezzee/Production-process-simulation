# Production-process-simulation

This project is a simple process simulation with 3 variables, which factor into 3 process parameters. User task is to operate with caution and prevent parameters from hitting too high values. What is more we needed to add timer, which every 20s evaluates operators presence. This task was a pass assigment.
